# Scrolling Support Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of enhanced scrolling support for the self-operating-computer framework. The improvements enable the agent to better handle and reason about scrolling actions when interacting with interfaces that require scrolling to access content or controls.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Templates

All three main system prompts have been updated with comprehensive scrolling guidance:

- **SYSTEM_PROMPT_STANDARD**: For basic coordinate-based interactions
- **SYSTEM_PROMPT_LABELED**: For labeled element interactions  
- **SYSTEM_PROMPT_OCR**: For OCR text-based interactions

### 2. Scrolling Guidance Section

Each prompt now includes a dedicated "SCROLLING GUIDANCE" section that explains:

- **Available scrolling keys**:
  - `pagedown` / `down` for scrolling down
  - `pageup` / `up` for scrolling up
  - `end` for scrolling to bottom
  - `home` for scrolling to top

- **When to scroll**:
  - When elements are not visible on current screen
  - For long web pages, documents, or lists
  - When content appears cut off
  - For infinite scroll interfaces
  - When scroll bars indicate more content

### 3. Practical Examples

Multiple scrolling examples have been added to each prompt:

#### Standard Prompt Examples
- Scroll down to find submit button on long form
- Scroll up to find navigation menu

#### Labeled Prompt Examples  
- Scroll down to find labeled submit button
- Scroll through list to find specific labeled content

#### OCR Prompt Examples
- Scroll down to find "Sign Up" button
- Navigate through long article content
- Scroll to bottom of form to find submit button
- Scroll to top to find navigation menu

### 4. Test Coverage

#### Enhanced Evaluation Tests
Added scrolling-specific test cases to `evaluate.py`:
- Google.com scrolling to find "I'm Feeling Lucky" button
- Wikipedia.org scrolling to find "Languages" section
- Long webpage scrolling to bottom
- Reddit.com scrolling through posts

#### Dedicated Test Suite
Created `test_scrolling.py` with comprehensive testing:
- **Unit tests**: Verify prompt content and key recognition
- **Integration tests**: Test scrolling in real scenarios
- **Evaluation framework**: Structured testing for different scroll types

#### Simple Validation Tests
Created `test_scrolling_simple.py` for basic validation without dependencies.

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

1. **operate/models/prompts.py**
   - Added "SCROLLING GUIDANCE" sections to all three system prompts
   - Removed TODO comment about scrolling implementation
   - Added multiple practical scrolling examples
   - Enhanced "important notes" sections with scrolling considerations

2. **evaluate.py**
   - Extended TEST_CASES with scrolling-specific scenarios
   - Added test cases covering different scrolling use cases

3. **New test files**
   - `test_scrolling.py`: Comprehensive test suite
   - `test_scrolling_simple.py`: Basic validation tests

### Scrolling Key Mapping

The implementation uses standard keyboard scrolling keys:

```python
SCROLLING_KEYS = {
    "scroll_down": ["pagedown", "down"],
    "scroll_up": ["pageup", "up"], 
    "scroll_to_bottom": ["end"],
    "scroll_to_top": ["home"]
}
```

### Example Usage

The agent can now handle scrolling scenarios like:

```json
[
    {
        "thought": "I need to find the submit button but don't see it. Let me scroll down",
        "operation": "press", 
        "keys": ["pagedown"]
    },
    {
        "thought": "Perfect! Now I can see the submit button",
        "operation": "click",
        "x": "0.50",
        "y": "0.85"
    }
]
```

## Scrolling Scenarios Covered

### 1. Form Navigation
- Long forms where submit buttons are below the fold
- Multi-step forms requiring scrolling between sections

### 2. Infinite Scroll Interfaces
- Social media feeds (Twitter, Instagram, Reddit)
- Product catalogs and search results
- News feeds and article lists

### 3. Document Reading
- Long articles and documentation
- Wikipedia pages and technical documents
- Blog posts and content pages

### 4. Navigation Access
- Finding navigation menus at page top
- Accessing footer links and information
- Locating page controls and buttons

### 5. Search Results
- Scrolling through Google search results
- E-commerce product listings
- Directory and catalog browsing

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Verify scrolling guidance exists in all prompts
- Test scrolling key recognition
- Validate example content

### 2. Integration Tests  
- Test real scrolling scenarios
- Verify agent can complete scrolling objectives
- Test different scroll types and distances

### 3. Regression Tests
- Ensure existing functionality still works
- Verify no breaking changes to current operations
- Test backward compatibility

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- Clear, descriptive scrolling examples
- Consistent formatting across all prompts
- Comprehensive documentation

### User Experience
- Intuitive scrolling behavior
- Appropriate scroll distances for different scenarios
- Clear guidance on when to scroll

### Performance
- Efficient scrolling operations
- Minimal impact on existing functionality
- Optimized for common scrolling patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Smart Scrolling**: Detect optimal scroll distances based on content
2. **Scroll Position Memory**: Remember scroll positions across actions
3. **Advanced Scroll Types**: Support for horizontal scrolling, zoom scrolling
4. **Visual Scroll Indicators**: Better detection of scrollable areas

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Track scrolling success rates
- Monitor common scrolling patterns
- Measure impact on task completion times

## Conclusion

The scrolling support implementation significantly enhances the agent's ability to interact with modern web interfaces and applications. By providing clear guidance, practical examples, and comprehensive test coverage, the agent can now effectively navigate content that extends beyond the initial viewport.

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities for handling scrolling scenarios that are common in today's user interfaces.
